            <h3>What We Do</h3>
            <font size="+2"><p>We are an  initiative aimed at teaching little kids at a daycare center how to play guitar. Our mission is to provide extracurricular activities that are often overlooked and undervalued. We noticed that the children at the daycare centre were very interested in the guitars; they were focused on the task at hand and allowed for free interaction. Despite the fact that the children had little musical experience, the sight of the guitars definitely excited them and drew their attention to us. Because our project is centred on music and instruments, the children were both auditory and visual learners.</p></font>

            <h3>Day 1</h3>
            <p>We went to Esperanza, surveyed the number of children and their interests towards music. We taught them what the guitar is, we taught them how to hold the guitar with correct posture, no. of strings. We finally ended the session with us playing songs to the kids and enjoying it with them. </p>

            <h3>Day 2</h3>
            <p>Taught them what each string was named and showed them how to play the guitar while holding it. We ended the session by letting the kids take control of the guitar, let them play whatever they wanted.</p>

            <h3>Day 3</h3>
            <p>We taught them what chords were and explained to them the structure of the guitar. We also had made them draw the guitar labelled completely based on their memory. We had asked them questions which they had answered correctly.</p>

            <h3>Providing instruments</h3>
            <p>We provided instruments to the daycare center so that the children had access to them during the lessons. We made sure that the instruments were of good quality and appropriate for children to use.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-card">
            <h3>Music theory and history lessons</h3>
            <p>We included basic music theory and history lessons as part of the guitar lessons. This helped the children to better understand the music they were playing and develop a deeper appreciation for music in general.

          <div class="text-card">
            <h3>Performance opportunities</h3>
            <p>We organized small concerts and recitals for the children to perform in front of their parents and other members of the daycare center community. This helped to build their confidence and showcase their musical talents.</p>

            <h3></h3>
            <p>At Tuning Initiative, we believe that music education is crucial for children's development, and we are committed to providing this opportunity to as many kids as possible. According to recent studies, only 20% of daycare centers offer music lessons to children. We believe that every child should have the opportunity to learn and enjoy music.</p>

          <div class="text-card">
            <h3></h3>
            <p>Learning to play an instrument, such as guitar, can improve cognitive skills, such as memory and attention span. This can lead to improved academic performance and overall success in life.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="text-card">
            <h3></h3>
            <p>A study by the National Endowment for the Arts found that students who participate in music programs are more likely to attend school, have higher rates of high school graduation, and are more likely to attend college than students who do not participate in music programs.</p>
